# Don't forget to surround abstract with double quotes
abstract: "As part of the ReScience Ten Years Reproducibility Challenge, I sought to reproduce the
    analyses in Lamichhane et al. (2003). The bulk of the code and data were quickly identified,
    though there were a number of challenges in reconstructing the analysis steps. There was little
    documentation and rather quirky file organization. And the code for one figure was not present
    in the main project directory but rather was discovered in a separate directory with presentation
    slides. Nevertheless, the bulk of the results could be reproduced to within Monte Carlo sampling
    error, with just one small change to the code to avoid errors due to a change in R. One of the
    paper's figures, however, could not be reproduced as the code for the computer simulations it
    presented could not be found."
